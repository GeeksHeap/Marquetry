Marquetry examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We've prepared 3 examples.
Which one is using Titanic Disaster which is a serious ship sinking, you know this as Movie.

Another one is using MNIST which is handwritten number images. We try to classify the image using CNN.

The last one is using TrigonometricCurve dataset which provides sin curve values when training,
and cos curve values in the test.
We try to predict the curve using RNN.

Let's start your journey with your curiosity! All ways are open to you!!
