==================================
The first step of using Marquetry
==================================

Welcome!
---------
Welcome to the Marquetry Get started!

And, I appreciate you installing Marquetry, Thank you very much!

Explain Marquetry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| At the first I'd like to explain this Framework to you.
| Oh, no need to explain? bore you? Sorry... please don't close this page...
| I agree with you, the most enjoyable thing of such framework is **use** the actual code!
| Ok, let's keep it short and to the point!
| This framework is developed as Deep Learning and Machine Learning framework.

Why...?
~~~~~~~~

:You: Why did you start to develop this framework? Already there were great frameworks for deep learning...?
:Me: Because it seems to be very fun and interesting!

| This is true, but I have one more reason for this.
| I wondered I wanted to create a framework for deep learning beginners, and I'd like to spread the fun!
| Surely, we can learn it from other frameworks like Tensorflow, PyTorch, or Chainer,
  but these frameworks are more complex for beginners.
| Furthermore, Tensorflow and PyTorch use a lot of c/c++ for optimizing the calculation process.
| In general work use cases, such optimizing is very important but for learners of Deep Learning mechanisms,
  it cannot help you...

| Therefore, I was starting to develop this framework to contribute to such a beginner person!
| This framework is written by only Python. And the implementation is very simple.
| If you are a worker, sorry, this framework can't fill your needs...,
  but if you are a learner of deep learning implementation, this framework is always beside you!

The bothered explanation is up now! So, **Let's start your journey!!**
