The first step of using Marquetry
==================================

Welcome!
---------
Welcome to the Marquetry Get started!

And, I appreciate you installing Marquetry, Thank you very much!

Explain Marquetry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the first I'd like to explain this Framework to you.
Oh, no need to explain? bore you? Sorry... please don't close this page...
I agree with you, the most enjoyable thing of such framework is **use** on the actual code, I think so too.
Ok, let's keep it short and to the point!
This framework is developed as Deep Learning and Machine Learning framework.

Why...?
~~~~~~~~

:You: Why did you started to develop this framework? Already there were greatful framework for deep learning...?
:Me: Because it seems to be very fun and interesting!

This is True, but I have one more reason of this.
I wondered I want to create a framework for deep learning beginners, and I'd like to spread the fun!
Surely, we can learn it from other framework like Tensorflow, PyTorch too, or Chainer, but these framework is more
complex for the beginners.
And more, for Tensorflow and PyTorch are used a lot of c/c++ for optimizing the calculate process.
In general work use case, such optimizing is very important but for learner of Deep Learning mechanism,
it cannot help you...

Therefore, I was starting to develop this framework to contribute such beginner person!
This framework is written by only Python. And the implementation is very simple.
If you are worker, sorry, this framework can't fill your needs..., but if you are learner of the deep learning
implementation, this framework always besides you!

The bothered explanation is up now! So, **Let's start your journey!!**
