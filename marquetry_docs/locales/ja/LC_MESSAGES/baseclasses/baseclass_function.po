"The main feature of this class is recording the computation graph for "
"back prop. When a function is applied to :class:`marquetry.Container` "
"objects, its :meth:`forward` method is called on :data:`Container.data` "
"fields of input containers, and at the same time it chains references "
"from output container nodes to the function and from the function to its "
"input nodes."

"For functions that do not need a part of inputs in backward computation, "
"there is a way to possibly reduce the memory consumption by quickly "
