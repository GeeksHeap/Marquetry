"On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered "
"“unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. "
"Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, "
"resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While "
"there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some "
"groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this "
"challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the "
"question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using "
"passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). (From "
"kaggle competition description.)"
