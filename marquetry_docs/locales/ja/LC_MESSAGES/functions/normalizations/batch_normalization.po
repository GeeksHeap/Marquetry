"Batch normalization is a technique used in deep neural networks to "
"stabilize and accelerate training. It normalizes the input data by "
"normalization and adjustable parameters called gamma(scale factor) and "
"beta(shift factor). This helps in preventing issues like vanishing "
"gradients, reduce co-variate shift, and allows for faster convergence."
