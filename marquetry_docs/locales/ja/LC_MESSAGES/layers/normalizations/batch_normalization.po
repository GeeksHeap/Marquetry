"Batch normalization is a technique used in deep neural networks to "
"stabilize and accelerate training. This layer normalizes the input data "
"by using normalization and adjustable parameters (gamma and beta). It "
"helps prevent issues like vanishing gradients, reduces co-variate shift, "
"and allows for faster convergence."
