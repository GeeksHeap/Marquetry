"Layer normalization is a technique used in deep neural networks to "
"stabilize and accelerate training. It normalizes the input data by "
"normalization and  adjustable parameters called gamma(scale factor) and "
"beta(shift factor). This doesn't depend on the batch size due to "
"normalize by the only 1 layer values. In some use cases, the stability is"
" better than :class:`marquetry.functions.BatchNormalization`. This helps "
"in preventing issues like vanishing gradients, reduce co-variate shift, "
"and allow for faster convergence."
