"Adam is an optimization algorithm that combines the concepts of "
"MomentumSGD and RMSProp to adaptively adjust the learning rates for each "
"parameter. It is known for its effectiveness in a wide range of "
"optimization problems."

"One of the peculiarities point of Adam optimizer is the adjustable "
"learning rate based on the current iteration. It combines the effects of "
"both first and second moment estimates."
