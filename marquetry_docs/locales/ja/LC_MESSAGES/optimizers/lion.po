"LION is an optimization algorithm that is explored by google AutoML to "
"reduce the memory efficient and convergence time than famous traditional "
"optimizers like Adam."

"The one of the speciality of LION is that LION using only sign of the "
"momentum param. The size of the updating only depends on the learning "
"rate."
